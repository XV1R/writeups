# stack-zero
#### Script
###### No script was used for this challenge.
#### Analysis
According to the challenge description, we have to overwrite the target value called *changeme*. 
Change me is found in the following struct:
```c
struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;
```
We can see that change me is a **volatile int**. This means that this variable of type **int** can change at any time without any action taken from code nearby. 
Reading this [arduino article](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/variable-scope-qualifiers/volatile/), we see that this variable will be loaded from RAM rather than a storage register, making the compiler not complain as mentioned before. 

Knowing this is our target, we can overwrite its value by passing through 64 bits of data followed by a value that isn't 0 to complete the challenge. 
```
python3 -c "print(b'A'*64+b'changed')" | ./stack-zero
```
